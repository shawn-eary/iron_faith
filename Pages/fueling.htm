<h1>Fuel (Nutrition / Hydration)</h1>
<h2>"Fatigue makes cowards of us all." - Lombardi [11] or Patton [12]</h2>
<p>
I personally tend to side with <a target="_blank" 
href="https://boblesser.com/posts/im-not-tired-fatigue-and-the-central-governor-theory">Bob Lesser</a> and believe that Ironman is 
99.9% mental; however, we each need to realize there may be certain limits
to our inborn willpower. Sooner or later during the Ironman experience, 
each of us experience a point of demoralization. While Yahweh has blessed
even Gentiles with bodies capable of phenomenal feats it doesn't hurt to
boost morale with a high-performance nutrition plan. 
</p>
<p>
Because the Ironman event is so long, keeping your Faith and willpower
high will be your highest priority, but your second biggest priority
will be to ensure you are putting quality food and hydration into the 
body the Lord has given you. While it's <b>theoretically</b> possible to do a
fair weather Ironman in a completely fasted state on nothing but water and Himalayan
salt, that is not advisable for all but the most seasoned of athletes.
While you want your body to be able to burn ketones in an emergency, you
will most likely be far better off starting off loaded up on carbs. See
what happened to some former pros when they tried doing a fasted Ironman
here on Global Triathlon Network (GTN):

</p>
<p>
Given the above, you will probably choose to feed yourself during race
day so it's very important that you train with some of the foods you
plan to consume on race day. You will need to learn to eat while cycling
and jogging without stopping. While you are allowed to stop during the
bicycle and jog legs, you should not allow yourself to do this if at 
all possible. You should especially not stop on training days unless You
are briefly transitioning between swim/bike or bike/jog legs.
</p>
<p>
With that said, your nutrition on race day may be "whacky" so your should
first concentrate on your everyday nutrition. Unless you are already a
well conditioned athlete, it can take a few years to train for an Ironman
so you need to focus on having a strong "baseline" nutrition. As I said,
Ironman is a life changing event: the first thing you should give up
is alcohol, the second is drugs/medications, and the third is processed
foods. You may recall where I elsewhere said that Ironman is a
life changing event, well it is. When you cross the Ironman finish line,
you will realize that you are a much different (and stronger) person
than you were before you began your training. So why is alcohol so bad?
</p>
<p>
  Alcohol trashes your liver and will block recovery gains from your
  training sessions.<br />

  <br />  
  As I said, while it's theoretically possible to
  do an Ironman in Ketosis, we aren't going to go that far, but we <b>do</b> want
  our bodies to be as responsive to natural sugar as possible on event
  day. Consuming alcohol will make it difficult for you to experience
  ketosis. As an athlete, you will mostly likely want carbs to be your
  primary fuel source, but you still want your body to be as adaptable as
  possible. While it is okay to eat thinks like basic foods like bananas [14] and sauerkraut [15] which may contain
  miniscule amounts of alcohol, you do not need the quantities that can be
  found in alcoholic beverages to interfere with your training. Ironman
  is hard enough as it is, you don't need alcohol getting in the way.
  Okay, but what about medications? 
</p>
<p>
  Medications have side effects. Some mess with your head. Others mess
  with your liver. <b>One</b> of the worst effects of medications is pain
  tolerance. Part of Ironman is about learning to tolerate and process
  physical pain. As part of the Ironman experience, you may learn to
  channel your emotional pain into your physical pain and drive harder
  than you ever have before. Unfortunately, if you are on "drugs" whether
  they be legal prescription or street, you may not feel physical pain
  when you should. Drugs regardless of source may enable you to train
  when you should not be and thereby cause an unwanted injury. In order
  to do Ironman right, you can't cheat. You must <b>feel</b> the pain.
  You must <b>feel</b> the sunlight and you will be able to sleep like
  a baby after a hard day of training. There are far too many dangers
  to taking any kind of medication or controversial supplement while
  training for or doing an Ironman. Don't do it. Let natural foods, 
  rest and good old fashioned sunlight (Vitamin D) be your remedies.
  Get off all prescription medications and/or street drugs before you
  get too deep into your training. So why should you give up Wheaties and
  Gatorade? 
</p>
<p>
  Okay, now you're probably thinking I'm nuts if you didn't decide that
  before, but the Lord Jesus did not make us to consume refined sugar.
  Wheaties (an "athlete's" food) contains refined sugar which is basically poison
  according to Dr. Robert Lustig of University of California:<br />  
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dBnniua6-oM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <br />
  The problem isn't just Wheaties though, it's common to 99.99% of the
  bread and cereal you can buy in most grocery stores like Walmart. These
  foods are processed. In the case of Wheaties, there seems to be a pretty
  good amount of fiber and minimal extra ingredients so Wheaties isn't 
  all bad, but compare Wheaties to 100% organic steel cut oats ("recipe" coming later)
  where there are <b>no</b> added ingredients. Then there is problem
  with how many processed foods high in the "wrong" kinds of fats and
  can create Omega-3 to Omega-6 imbalances <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/foods-high-in-omega-6" target="_blank">[18]</a>.
  There is also the issue of soda pop and sports drinks. I used to 
  think Gatorade was good for ultra endurance athletes. My church's 
  associate minister even said (in certain worlds) in a sermon once (as a side note) that 
  Gatorade doesn't actually work and you are better off drinking water. 
  I strongly disagreed with him at the time, but a year or so later, I realized he was right.
  Take a look at the side of a Gatorade can or beverage. What do you see?
  Water, sugar, "citric acid", Salt, Potassium and junk. You can get
  these things in common food or by drinking ice cold <a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/536637-daily-consumption-of-pomegranates/" target="_blank">POM</a> during your
  training or event days and you will be healthier to boot <a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/536637-daily-consumption-of-pomegranates/" target="_blank">[19]</a>.
  POM has other health benefits I can't get into tonight although excessive
  intake may cause heartburn in sensitive individuals like myself. Finally,
  if you can't afford to drink gobs of POM (or Beet Juice) every training
  session, but a small amount of Himalayan salt in your water and pack
  some baked potatoes, cucumbers or pickles. Let me tell you though, 
  ice cold POM can be your race day super weapon. Freeze it and over night
  and have it ready when you get out of the swim and ready to start
  your bike ride <a target="_blank" href="https://www.diys.com/water-bottles/">[20]</a>. Please be advised it may make a huge mess since POM
  may try to come out of your water bottle and stain anything nearby, 
  but on event day almost everyone will understand and it will probably
  taste way better than Gatorade to you and be healthier.<br />
  <br />
  NOTE: If you aren't comfortable with freezing your water bottle a
  safer option would be to pack it your POM with tons of ice the morning
  of the event. You should have brief access to your bicycle before you
  start your swim. Don't waste your time freezing your marathon or 
  water bottles. Unless you are doing Ironman Alaska, the ice will 
  probably melt before you get to T2 just before the marathon.<br />
