<p>
For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this
is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God not by works, so that no
one can boast. [Ephesians 2:8-9 NIV]
</p>
<p>
"For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, 
“plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope
and a future." [Jeremiah 29:11 NIV]
