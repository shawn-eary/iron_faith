<h1>Why Do an Ironman?</h1>
<p>I'm just getting started so you're probably wondering why a burnt
out computer programmer is bothering to write this eBook. There isn't
much here and I'm certainly no athletic professional, but there is a
much bigger question at stake.
</p>
<h2>Why Should <u><b>You</b></u> do a full Ironman?</h2>
<p>
Why should you get up early in the morning and train for the next few
<b>years</b> so you can: swim 2.4 miles ride a bike 112-miles and then run a
26.22 mile marathon thereby beating your body to exhaustion?
</p>
<p>
It's because Ironman is about change. This book is dedicated to my
daughter Faith because Ironman is as much a spiritual journey as it is a
physical journey. Many Ironman finishers will tell you the Ironman
experience is a life changing event. I feel very strongly that once you
ethically cross the Ironman finish line, you will never be the same
again.
</p>
<p>
Some people are going to think you are crazy, stupid and/or would be just
plain wasting your time to do something that is both seemingly mundane
<b>and</b> impossible at the same time. On the one hand, the idea of
wasting nearly every ounce of the valuable free time the Lord has given you
so you can exercise seems selfish; but on the other, you might be surprised how
empowered in the Lord you feel when you have learned to swim 2.4 maybe
even 4 or 5 miles in a lake when you could barely swim 25 <b>yards</b>
to start. Also, if you are anything like me and other Ironman competitors,
at some point during your training or the event, you <b>will</b> wind up
praying. The "Ironman Process" is a transformation where you take off
your old self and open up to meditation, prayer and self-discipline.
Ironman is a journey of Faith.
</p>
<p>
Besides being a great way to reunite with the Lord as sister
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_Buder"
target="_blank">Maddona Budder</a> does. Ironman is a great way to
heal from anxiety, depression and prescription/
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.triathlete.com/culture/news/lionel-sanders-on-overcoming-drug-addiction/">illegal drug dependencies</a>.
You take Ironman seriously, so as you progress through this process, you
will likely find yourself gradually needing less prescription medications
and your sleeping patterns will probably get better. While the rest of
the world is sitting around on their rears binging on Netflix and consuming
an excess of processed foods, you will be out in the heat jogging your
final miles of that day showing everyone what you are <b>really</b> made of.
Through Ironman, you will show the world that are are <b>not</b> a quitter and
that you don't change course lightly. While I can't overemphasize how much
Faith you will use and develop to cross the finish line, Ironman
isn't only a journey of Faith. For some, Ironman can be a "Reset Button"
</p>
<p>
I write to you in this style because I'm confident in your ability to
finish a full Ironman. I look forward to sharing my Ironman experience
and training thoughts with you in the days ahead, but there is a very 
small portion of people that do need to take pause before embarking on
something this monumental and potentially dangerous. While <b>most</b>
people still have far more "juice" in their bodies than they can possibly
imagine, it wouldn't hurt to discuss your training thoughts with a general
physician. While Ironman can bring great healing for most, it can actually
cause great harm to others. You <b>must</b> be aware of the reckless vehicle
drivers, elements of nature, cramps and water creatures you will encounter. 
You will also need to be aware of the state of your body <b>before</b>
you begin training. If you can't swim 25 years in a pool without getting
out of breath, then don't go out immediately and try open water swimming.
Also, not only will you need to discuss your plans with your doctor and
get the okay to start your training regimen, but you will need to gradually
get off any medications you may be taking.
</p>
<p>
I want <b>you</b> to finish your full Ironman, but I must be clear. I am
a computer programmer by trade. I am not a physician, nutritionist or
athletic trainer. I completed my first and possibly only Ironman in Florida and have learned
at lot along the way. What I will say in this eBook will come with absolutely
no warranty. I am not qualified to give you any kind of coaching or medical
advice. Should the Lord allow me to finish, and I find the discipline to avoid
excessive distraction, you will find an amateur athlete's perspective
on how to successfully complete an Ironman and what the process can do
for you.
</p>
<p>
I'm sorry to muddy the waters of "why" with all of that medical disclaimer
"junk" at the end, but I do <b>not</b> want anyone to get seriously hurt.
If you: listen to your doctor; get off the any drugs you might be taking;
properly observe rest days; and, get plenty of sleep, you should have this
thing down. It will cost a lot of time and money, but if you continue to
honor the Lord Jesus Christ first and your family second during this
trying process, it will be worth it in the end. A parting thought. This
training is very difficult and takes a lot of resources - don't short change
your family. Keep the Lord Jesus Christ first and do not neglect the
blessings the Lord has given you.

Finally, I'm not sure how the licensing works for this particular video,
but want to leave you with a work of art that describes what
Ironman is about much better than I can:

Make sure you open it full screen and turn it up loud!!!<br />

Happy Training - I Hope to Write Again Soon,<br />
