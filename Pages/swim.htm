<h1>The Washing Machine (aka: Ironman Swim)</h1>
<p>
Let's get straight to the point. While some people will disagree with
me, I believe the hardest and most dangerous leg of an Ironman course is
the 2.4 mile swim. You probably learned to ride a bicycle at some point
in your life and likely already know how to jog/walk. In some Ironman
courses like Ironman Florida you can lay down into your Aero Bars to
rest a bit on the bike leg. Also, on the marathon, you are allowed to
walk. I think policies vary according to event, but one source says you
are allowed 6 hours and 30 minutes to complete the 26.22 mile marathon
[4][6]. Unless you've completely fouled something up like
nutrition/hydration or just completely blew of your marathon training,
the marathon is when your horses will smell the barn.
</p>
<p>
Because I believe the swim is so dangerous and difficult for most people.
We put most of the focus on that, but first I want to tell you a bit of 
a story about myself. Before I can even remember, my parents divorced with
my dad getting full custody. Like me, I think both of my parents had anger
management issues <b>and</b> incompatible types. Out of this very odd
relationship of temporary lust my dad "knocked my mother up" and a
rather insecure and timid child began to form. Doing the right thing,
my parents decided to marry, but that didn't last long... I don't remember
much, but I think a very special person in my life said my parents divorced
before I was two years old.
</p>
<p>
My dad, grandma and grandpa raised me, but again before I can even
remember, my dad got a U.S. Army transfer to Hawaii. You're thinking wait
Hawaii. I'd love to go there!!! I wanna make Kona, but at my very young
age, it was pure "hell" for me. Not only was my mother gone, but I was
now forced to move with my dad away from my grandpa and grandma. My
grandmother had served as my surrogate mother up to this point. My dad
was stern and I knew he loved me, but at this young age well before
kindergarten, I had already lost my mom and now I'm loosing my grandma.
It doesn't end there though.
</p>
<p>
My dad and I get to Hawaii and I'm the loser child. The other kids stole at least
one of my favorite toys from me. I was forced to take showers which I couldn't
stand because I was too young to understand how to shower without
swallowing a little water. One day my dad decides to teach me
(apparently a two year old) to surf...
</p>
<p>
All I can remember is that I was horrified on the surfboard. I wasn't out
there long before a wave came in and under I went <b>despite</b> that fact
that my dad was holding the surfboard I was standing on. It didn't take me long
to blackout. My dad later told me he had to do mouth to mouth on me to get
me to come back to. 
</p>
<p>
This started a very intense fear of water that I held for about ten years
of my life. That's where my grandpa comes in. My dad 
decided to get out of U.S. Army because he felt than I needed him more
than the U.S. Army needed him. They gave him an honorable discharge on
account of me. Before I was five years old I was already back in my "hometown" attending kindergarten
with my dad, grandma and grandpa all rasing me again. Live was good
until I was about 14 or 15.
</p>
<p>
My grandpa (a former Navy SeaBee) told me I needed to face my fear. I
was 14 or 15 and scared as can be of the water. Sure I would go in pools
where I could stand up but I was horrified of water slides because I was
always afraid I wouldn't be able stand up during the big splash at the end.
</p>
<p>
Long story short - at 14/15 my grandpa enrolled me in swimming lessons and
I did well in beginning lessons until a pre-test. You can guess what happened there. 
I swallowed more water. Fortunately, I didn't blackout, but it really
sucked. I didn't want to go back the next day, but my grandpa (the SeaBee)
talked me into it and I eventually wound up passing the Red Cross Lifeguard
training a year or so later, but I still "sucked" at swimming.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I improved greatly. As a lifeguard, no one ever drowned on my watch, but 
I was bordering on incompetency. I would have "nightmares" at night where
I would constantly chant "gotta watch the patrons" over an over. Fortunately,
no one ever drowned in my dreams or during duty. Sadly, however, I was just
floating by as incompetent 16/17 year old pool lifeguard working at the local
U.S. Army base. I should have
taken my training more seriously but since I passed the Red Cross course, 
I thought that was enough. It wasn't. Not by a long shot...
</p>
<p>
Years, later I'm like 44 years old and have three beautiful children, but the
beloved mother of those children has left me <b>with</b> the children. I try to make things work,
but they just don't. I had gotten into competitive cycling and just finished
the Dirty Kanza 200 and some guy talks me into triathlon. I knew I was an
okay runner and former lifeguard so stupid competitive cyclist me said 
why not? With the love of my life gone with my children due to my anger
management issues, I signed up for an Ironman.   
</p>
<p>
When I got back in the pool / open water, I could barely swim 25 yards
without getting out of breath even though I could cycle well and run
pretty good. I was a former lifeguard and I could barely swim 25 yards on front crawl.
That's absolutely pathetic... Fortunately, lifeguards are very good at
the sidestroke so that carried me a little ways and I knew breaststroke well also. Lifeguards are also very good
at staying calm in the water. I was no longer afraid of the water. That
proved to be very handy during <b>early</b> training when I would cramp one of my legs/feet or 
during <b>later</b> training when I found myself in choppy water or misjudged currents.
</p>
<p>
I'm going to have to clean this story up at some point because it's too
long, but this is an elaborate way for me to say to you 
"DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DIFFICULTY OF THE IRONMAN SWIM". It is totally
within your reach to face your fears like I did and dream of going back
to Hawaii someday, but be prepared. Please, if you don't have a competitive
swimming background and you are considering an Ironman, stop right now.
Go take the Red Cross Lifeguard course and graduate, <b>then</b>
come back. The crawl will most likely be your weapon of choice in the
Ironman swim but Red Cross Lifeguard training will still serve you well
in your Ironman journey.
</p>
<p>
BTW: None of this is meant to be construed as ill feelings toward my
parents. My dad loved me very much and we share the same middle name
O'Neal. I am very proud of that name especially since I now would love
to learn how to surf. I even named a simple
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRGS2DW2">app</a> after
my late dad. Also, my mother and I are working on our relationship even if it took a hit
when my beloved Jennifer left me. Please pray for Jennifer and my children.
Jennifer doesn't understand right now because I am an Irish hothead, but
Jennifer, Grace, Faith and Hope all mean the world to me. In case your
wondering, I feel I am a better man today for having completed Ironman Florida
than I was when Jennifer still lived with me.
