<h1>Personal Hacks of Nutrition by Shawn Eary of Utilars™</h1>
<h2>Breakfast Cereal Alternative (Beta)</h2>
<p>
There is a controversy out there on whether or not natural unprocessed oatmeal is good or
bad for you, so you will have to take this recipe with a teaspoon of
salt (bad "pun" intended), but I would argue that it much more athlete
friendly and healthy than Wheaties and "may" have a lower
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/glycemic-index">Glycemic Index.</a>.
Also, I feel it <b>may</b> be naturally nutrient dense for those that don't
want to consume <b>tons</b> of synthetic vitamins. It should also have
very little unnatural sugars. Nothing in this recipe should be excessively
processed.

<h3>Total <u>Guestimated</u> Time to Make: 40 Minutes</h3>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ol>
<li>1/2 Cup Bob's Red Mill Organic <b>Steel Cut</b> Oats</li>
<li>1/2 Cup Juice from Walmart Canned Salmon<br />
(Just the juice - Bake the Salmon to eat separately or later. You
can put Salmon in this concoction if you really want, but don't go
overboard as you will probably enjoy the salmon better separately)</li>
<li>1/2 Cup <b>Filtered</b> Water</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Pink Himalayan Salt</li>
<li>1/2 cup chopped onions</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chopped garlic</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chopped ginger</li>
<li>3/4 cup raisins</li>
<li>2 tbsp Wheat Germ</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
<li>1/2 tbsp grass-fed butter<br />
(Keep away from the stove since this will be mixed in later at lower
heat. Also, <b>DO NOT USE margarine or Country Crock!!! <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alexfergus.com/blog/11-reasons-to-avoid-margarine">[30]</a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Ma-r3YPYQ">[31]</a></b>)</li>
<li>3/4 sliced banana</li>
<li>No More than - 1 tbsp Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar (optional to taste)<br />
For safety reasons, <b>do not</b> add more than 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar
even if you like the taste</li>
</ol>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Combine Water, Salmon Juice, Steel Cut Oats and Himalayan Salt in 4qt pot
  on high heat. Heat until boil, then reduce to simmer.</li>
<li>Mix in onions and ginger while oatmeal is simmering</li>
<li>Wait until oatmeal starts to thicken and liquid first starts to
disappear. Stir occasionally.
</li>
<li>
Diligently mix in the now softened butter
</li>
<li>
When the oatmeal becomes just slightly more liquidy than you normally
like, start mixing in the garlic and raisins
</li>
<li>
Begin mixing in the Wheat Germ until the oatmeal is just barely more
liquidly than you like. The oatmeal will start to thicken and rapidly
approach your desired consistency
</li>
<li>
Remove heat
</li>
<li>
Add in optional Apple Cider Vinegar
</li>
<li>
Mix in cinnamon and sliced banana.
</li>
<li>
Wait for oatmeal to cool down before eating<br />
If you are like me you can eat it right out of the pot (ha ha!!!)<br />
</li>
</ol>

NOTEs: <br />
<ol>
<li>On the recipe above, Steel Cut is <b>very</b> important and also
  you should not get instant. Steel Cut oats take longer to prepare, but
  that is a good thing as it may lower the Glycemic Index which should
  allow the food to burn slower throughout your endurance event. Also,
  the steel cut oats should be safer to consume frequently since the
  lower perceived Glycemic Index will hopefully reduce the amount of
  insulin that becomes stored in your body. Please understand that while
  there are probably other breakfast foods like pasture raised chicken eggs
  that might offer and even lower Glycemic Index and even better nutrition
  benefits, I am pitching this particular recipe as an alternative to the
  "poisonous" cereals you often find in a typical grocery store.</li>
<li>For reasons I don't want to get into right now, it's very important
that you use filtered or drinking quality water in this and all foods
you consume. You don't need added sugars minerals or vitamins, but you
need to get the fluoride and other chemicals out of your drinking water
because they can impede your athletic performance. You should exercise
proper oral hygiene after consuming this food (especially if you
added the apple cider vinegar) but you do <b>not</b> want chemicals 
like fluoride in your drinking water. Fluoride goes on your teeth
<b>not</b> in your stomach...
</li>
<li>
The purpose of the optional apple cider vinegar is to potentially further
lower the glycemic index of this food <a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-proven-health-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar">[28]</a>.
You may not like the taste that
the apple cider vinegar brings but the oatmeal mixture may make the
apple cider vinegar more palatable than if you put it straight
in your morning water or other athlete friendly beverage.<br />
<br />
WARNING: Soda Pop, Most Juices and Gatorade are <b>not</b> what I consider
athlete family beverages. Most people should avoid juices and Gatorade 
altogether. Also, athletes should only consume Gatorade / juice at strategic times on event
days. A few slight exceptions to this is are organic beet juice and POM branded
pomegranate juice. Both of these juices have benefits that can
sometimes outweigh the negative impacts they have on insulin sensitivity.
If used responsibly, beet juice and POM can significantly increase your
health and athletic performance. You might think that V8 vegetable juice
is also a healthy option, but it's probably better to just eat the
constituent vegetables raw in their un-juiced form. 
<br />
Warning and Disclaimer: Please
understand that apple cider vinegar can potentially corrode your teeth
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/apple-cider-vinegar-88768">[29]</a>
and/or cause other health issues if used improperly.<br />
<br />
Make sure you use proper dental technique after consuming the above
oatmeal concoction with the apple cider vinegar added. I cannot currently recommend a good technique for
neutralizing the apple cider vinegar at this time since you may need
to refuel again in a few hours depending on your situation, but you
need to be mindful of your teeth. If you don't plan on fueling with
beet juice soon you <b>may</b> be able to neutralize some of the apple cider
vinegar by swishing with unsweetened green tea or a (baking soda / water) mixture.
If you use the baking soda / water mixture, remember to spit it out 
and not swallow. If all of this makes you nervous, you can leave the
apple cider vinegar out but you <b>still</b> need to practice proper
oral hygiene.
