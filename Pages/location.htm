A potentially underestimated component of the Ironman for newcomers is
where you chose to compete. Each Ironman site has a different athlete
culture; different terrain and weather to deal with; and tourism
experience.
</p>
<p>
My memory is vague on this, but some Ironman sites may have either male
only or just female only pro athletes. On the other hand, some sites
may (in a given year) have no pro athletes at all. Ideally, you might
regularly visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ironman.com">https://www.ironman.com</a>
for a year or two comparing courses and watching a few live events before
committing to a particular course, but you may not have that kind of
time so you might just ask around in various forums or on Facebook to
get a feel for what courses you might like and what kind of pros
<b>might</b> show up in a given year. Meeting your favorite Ironman pro
at an event might be a bit tricky, but you want to keep you camera and
a sharpie on hand just in case. When I did Ironman Florida, I had Hope to run into
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.andrewstarykowicz.com/">Andrew Starykowicz [7]</a>
or <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hoffman_(triathlete)">Ben Hoffman [8]</a>
but instead I ran across the ever incredible <a target="_blank" href="https://lsanderstri.com/">Lionel Sanders [9]</a>
He was just hanging out offering selfies and autographs at the Ironman
breakfast the day following the event and I had a chance to talk to him, but I
didn't have a sharpie and other things on hand. I made the mistake of
going back to the car and a local store a few times to try to get a
sharpie and my phone so he could autograph an a free Ironman backpack I
wanted to give to my daughter Faith. I think the first time I left and
came back he was still there, but I think the second time I left and
came back he was gone. I should have been more prepared to get the
autograph for my daughter. I've already given my daughter the backpack, 
but Lionel probably would have let me ship it to his business for an
"out of band" signing. Regardless, be mindful of where you decide to do
your Ironman and be prepared to come across world class athletes. I
missed out on a good opportunity because I wasn't prepared.

The terrain and weather are going to have a huge impact on how hard you
will have to work to cross the finish line. Generally speaking, Ironman
Florida is one of the easiest Ironman courses there is <b>except</b> for 
the swim which is IMO the hardest event of an Ironman. If you can swim
really well but you can't bike or run worth a hoot. Ironman Florida is
probably the event for you. The bike course and run are very flat and 
the temperatures are typically mild except the year I did Ironman Florida,
but that's another story. In contrast if you have a super low BMI like
me and are a good runner and cyclist (like me), then Ironman Chattanooga
might be easier for you. You will need to verify for yourself, but I
think I heard there is a water current that will "carry you" on the
Ironman Chattanooga swim. With that said, if I ever do a second Ironman,
it will probably be a repeat of Ironman Florida. My third Ironman can be
Ironman Chattanooga or Ironman Tulsa if the Tulsa site is still running
by the time I get back to Ironman. If you are slightly overweight, you 
will very likely appreciate Ironman florida because of the increased
buoyancy you will feel in the ocean water, but if you are a little 
overweight and you try to do Ironman Chattanooga, the hills and heat will
likely shred you to pieces on the bike and run legs. That's a long way
for me to say "play to your strengths" for your first few Ironman events.

Regarding tourism, part of the reason I choose Ironman Florida was out
of depression. I saw the beautiful clear water on the commercials and
I thought wow. I want to be a part of that. I want to see sea creatures.
Unfortunately, while the water is clear is wasn't as clear as I thought
it would be on the year I went and there was a drastic weather change on
event day. Anyway, even though I arrived early and did a few training
swims, about that only thing I saw out there was several boring white
jelly fish that scared me a bit. I may have run across one Man of War
out there but my memory is a bit sketchy on that. I do remember one
jelly fish in particular scaring me quite a bit when I was swimming
alone during a training/familiarization swim, but I'm not sure if it
was actually Man of War. If I remember correctly, it wasn't white...
Basically, I didn't see anything worth seeing out there. I had a better
experience with Jennifer some years ago during an anniversary 
<a target="_blank" href="https://discoverycove.com/orlando/">Discovery Cove</a> trip where you swim in a "simulated" ocean environment that is 
much safer. Chose where you will do your Ironman "vacation" wisely and
make sure you have plenty of rest time. One good thing about Ironman
Florida was that I got a really good hotel deal (due to people still
freaking out about COVID - and early booking) so I was able to just
stretch out on the because whenever I wanted to and catch some much 
needed rest and Vitamin D. I was also able to go on training swims in
they ocean whenever I wanted if I was willing to put up with the scary
jelly fish. I'm glad I didn't see a shark...
</p>
<p>
Where you do your Ironman will also impact greatly on cost, your diet
and where you sleep. Had I stuck with Ironman Tulsa, and just wanted
another year, I would have not only probably had an easier experience
for me, but I probably would have rested better and spent much less
money. I just *had* to see the ocean though. I sort of dreamed of making
it to Kona and facing my fear from when I almost drowned as a two year
old in Hawaii. Ultimately, I was way too slow for Kona and I nearly got
spit out on the Ironman Florida swim, but I did make the cutoff time
and the rest of the event day was fairly easier from there. If you can
do your first few Ironman events close to your home, you will likely
get better sleep and nutrition and thereby have an advantage.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, it goes without saying that you should train in an environment
that will be similar to the course you expect to perform in. In my case, 
it was nearly impossible for me to swim train in the oceans, but every
weekend I did my open water swim in a lake or a river. I did not shy 
away from choppy water because I knew Ironman Florida might get nasty on
event day and it sure enough it did. If you will have hills on the bike
and run legs of your Ironman course, then you need to train on hills at
home. Also, you will did to do what they call "brick training" and you
should probably training in both the heat and the cold so you can be 
prepared for whatever. In general, I think Ironman Florida is historically
mild but it was stupid cold the in the morning before the swim they year
I did it and the chop was worse than usual.

One more thing, if money was <b>not</b> an option, this is the "Ironman"
I would do:<br />

NOTE: It's not actually licensed by Ironman but it is Ironman distance
and it is one of the hardest Ironman distance events a person will ever
do. It's not something you would want to do for your <b>first</b> Ironman
though.
