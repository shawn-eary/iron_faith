<h1>Equalizer - Women vs Men in the Great Ironman Challenge</h1>
<h2>"He created them male and female and blessed them..." - Genesis 5:2 NIV</h2>
<p>
This eBook is a Christian eBook. It's about how you woman or man can
honor the Lord Jesus Christ in your journey of Faith to become and Ironman.
Since I am a male, I tend to write from a male's perspective; however, I
have three beautiful daughters Grace, Faith and Hope whom I love dearly 
despite my inability behave according the calling the Lord Jesus Christian
places on each of his followers. Like Paul, I am chief among sinners
1 Timothy 1:15. With that said, this book is dedicated to my middle
daughter Faith and I would be delighted to see any of my daughters become
Ironmen someday. 
</p>
<p>
This part is so way over my head, but it needs to be addressed because
I will repeatedly talk about how and athlete can optimize testosterone
throughout this book. For biological males, this is absolutely critical, 
but for women is is also likely still important <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/12/health/testosterone-and-hyperandrogenism-in-female-athletes/index.html" target="_blank">[22]</a>.
So if you are a woman and I start talking about testosterone, please don't
shut me off. I want as many people as possible to finish the Ironman
challenge without cheating. Your physician can help ensure that your
nutrition, sleep, training and other elements are aligned such that your
hormones achieve the best possible athletic performance.

I really don't want to get to deep into this because I'm afraid I'll say
something "off", but there also seem to be a few other differences between
men and women in Ironman competitions. For one, you can do the research
yourself, but women are AMAZING swimmers <a href="http://www.vaswim.org/OW_women_v_men.pdf" target="_blank">[23]</a>!!!
When I swim in the local pool, I'm constantly getting my rear end kicked
by women in the other lanes. Fortunately, even a slow swimmer like myself
is capable of finishing the Ironman Florida swim before the cutoff time.
So if you are a woman, take courage that you may be "born to rock" the
Ironman Florida swim.
</p>
<p>
Another difference between women and men in endurance sports is that
woman may be able to handle "the wall" and physical suffering better than men.
Yes, men do tend to have a higher VO2Max, but I believe some sources
feel women <b>may</b> have an advantage in fat burning. While this still
seems to be controversial, it appears that some sources believe that women 
can burn fat more efficiently than men

Since I am an amateur age-grouper athlete with a day job, I'm not attempting
to write this eBook for professional Ironman competitors. I'm writing it
for everyday folk that need to show the world they still have something
left in them when many have given up on them or turned their noses at them.
As I said, Ironman is about willpower, patience, longsuffering and Faith.
I Hope that Ironman can be an event where Christians across the world can
improve their fruits of the spirit Galatians 5:22-23 NIV. Pray while you
train (when it is safe to do so).
</p>
<p>
If you want Ironman bad enough, you will go out and grab it whether you are female
or male so don't get too hung up if I get your gender (female or male) wrong
or talk too much about testosterone. I'm just trying to help in a manner
that would honor <b>my</b> Lord Jesus Christ. I'm a goofball and a 
horrible failure without Christ so I'm liable
to say something wrong from time to time. With that said, I urge you to hang in there
and to <b>not</b> give up.
