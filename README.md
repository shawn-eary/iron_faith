# Iron Faith
IronFaith is ultimately meant to be an athletic training eBook. Currently, I'm just doing very crude work on the UI.

The eBook will be dedicated to my middle child Caitlin Faith Eary because she is a tenacious, feisty girl that loves to surprise me with her bounty of mental strength. The Lord has blessed me with three beautiful daughters and I look forward to continually see them each grow in Grace, Hope and Faith.

There ain't much there right now, but the Alpha version of this eBook will
be "openable" at the following URL:
